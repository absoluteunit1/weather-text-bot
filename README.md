Weather Text Bot

I wanted to create a simple program that I would use. 

I created this text-bot using the following tools:

- Python, OpenWeatherAPI, Twilio 

Using this program, I wrote a shell script that will execute it everyday at 10pm. This bot will then text me the weather conditions for the next day at 9am and for 3pm. I find this quite useful as I often forget to check the weather and will end not dressing accordingly. Having the bot text me the weather for the next day is very convenient.
